## 🌱 What is Bokaka?

Bokaka is a pocket‑sized device that allows fans to exchange identity tokens simply by tapping their cards together.  
Each successful interaction lights up part of an LED pattern on the card—forming leeks, Miku‑themed shapes, or rare animations as you meet more fans.

- Meet someone → Tap cards  
- Cards exchange secure IDs  
- Your LED pattern grows  
- Reach milestones → unlock animations  
- Sync to the website → view your connection graph

Bokaka turns fan encounters into a visual memory you can carry.
